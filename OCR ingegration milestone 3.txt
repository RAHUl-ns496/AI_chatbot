AI Document Assistant with OCR & PDF Analysis

Overview
This project is an advanced AI-powered document assistant built using Streamlit, Ollama (LLaMA 3), Tesseract OCR, and PyPDF2.
It allows users to upload images or PDF documents, automatically extract text, analyze sentiment, and interact with the document through an intelligent chat interface powered by LLaMA 3.

System Architecture:
Workflow:
User → Streamlit UI → OCR/PDF Extractor → LLaMA 3 (via Ollama API) → Response → Display/Report

Key Components:
Frontend (Streamlit): Provides a clean, modern, and interactive UI for uploading, previewing, and chatting with documents.
OCR Engine (Tesseract): Extracts text from uploaded images.
PDF Reader (PyPDF2): Reads and extracts textual data from PDF pages.
Sentiment Analysis (TextBlob): Detects overall tone (Positive, Negative, Neutral).
LLM Engine (LLaMA 3 via Ollama): Answers document-based queries or provides summaries.

Libraries & Tools Used:
Streamlit: Used as the main UI framework to create an interactive and responsive web interface for document upload, display, and AI chat.
pytesseract & PIL (Pillow): Power the OCR functionality, enabling accurate text extraction from images.
PyPDF2: Handles PDF processing by reading and extracting text from multi-page PDF documents.
Ollama (LLaMA 3): Acts as the AI chat model, generating contextual and document-based responses to user queries.
TextBlob: Performs sentiment analysis to determine whether the document’s tone is positive, negative, or neutral.
requests, json, datetime: Manage HTTP API communication, handle data structures, and record timestamps for reports and logs.
